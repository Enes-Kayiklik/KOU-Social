## Architecture üóº

- Single Activity No Fragment
- MVVM Pattern

**View:** Renders UI and delegates user actions to ViewModel

**ViewModel:** Can have simple UI logic but most of the time just gets the data from UseCase.

**UseCase:** Contains all business rules and they written in the manner of single responsibility
principle.

**Repository:** Single source of data. Responsible to get data from one or more data sources.

**For more information you can
check [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide?gclid=CjwKCAiA_omPBhBBEiwAcg7smXcfbEYneoLKFD_4Tyw0OgVQkpZL_XIr5TPXT0mncuQhgDIBBvLhbBoCEx0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#mobile-app-ux)**
